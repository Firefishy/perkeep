# Contributing

## Getting Started

Perkeep contributors regularly use Linux and macOS, and both are
100% supported.

Developing on Windows is sometimes broken, but should work. Let us
know if we broke something, or we accidentally depend on some
Unix-specific build tool somewhere.

See https://perkeep.org/doc/contributing for information on how to
contribute to the project and submit patches.

See architecture docs: https://perkeep.org/doc/

You can view docs for Perkeep packages with local godoc, or
godoc.org.

It's recommended you use git to fetch the source code, rather than
hack from a Perkeep release's zip file:

    $ git clone https://github.com/perkeep/perkeep.git perkeep.org

On Debian/Ubuntu, some deps to get started:

    $ sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 pkg-config git

During development, rather than using the main binaries ("pk", "pk-put",
"pk-get", "pk-mount", etc) directly, we instead use a wrapper (devcam)
that automatically configures the environment to use the test server &
test environment.

## Building devcam

We have a development tool to help with Perkeep development that's
named `devcam` (for historical reasons: Perkeep used to be named
Camlistore).

To build devcam:

    $ go run make.go

And devcam will be in &lt;pkroot&gt;/bin/devcam.  You'll probably want to
symlink it into your $PATH.

Alternatively, if your Perkeep root is checked out at
$GOPATH/src/perkeep.org (optional, but natural for Go users), you
can just:

    $ go install ./dev/devcam

## Running devcam

The subcommands of devcam start the server or run pk-put/pk-get/etc:

    $ devcam server      # main server
    $ devcam put         # pk-put
    $ devcam get         # pk-get
    $ devcam tool        # pk
    $ devcam mount       # pk-mount

Once the dev server is running,

- Upload a file:

      devcam put file ~/perkeep/COPYING

- Create a permanode:

      devcam put permanode

- Use the UI: http://localhost:3179/ui/


## Testing Patches

Before submitting a patch, you should check that all the tests pass with:

    $ devcam test

You can use your usual git workflow to commit your changes, but for each
change to be reviewed you should merge your commits into one before sending
a GitHub Pull Request for review.

## Commit Messages

You should also try to write a meaningful commit message, which at least states
in the first sentence what part or package of perkeep this commit is affecting.
The following text should state what problem the change is addressing, and how.
Finally, you should refer to the github issue(s) the commit is addressing, if any,
and with the appropriate keyword if the commit is fixing the issue. (See
https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/).

For example:

> pkg/search: add "file" predicate to search by file name
>
> File names were already indexed but there was no way to query the index for a file
> by its name. The "file" predicate can now be used in search expressions (e.g. in the
> search box of the web user interface) to achieve that.
>
> Fixes #10987

## Contributors

We follow the Go convention for commits (messages) about new Contributors.
See https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html#copyright , and examples such as
https://perkeep.org/gw/85bf99a7, and https://perkeep.org/gw/8f9af410.

## git Hooks

You can optionally use our pre-commit hook so that your code gets gofmt'ed
before being submitted (which should be done anyway).

    $ devcam hook

Please update this file as appropriate.
